# 7 Ways To Ace Life The Inward Way

Our greatest misconception is that if we focus on fixing the outer, the inner will resolve itself. In other words, we mistakenly believe that if we find the right partner, make all the money, become outwardly successful through external achievement, perfect our bodies, etc, we will finally feel fulfilled, happy, worthy, beautiful, whole and free.

But the actual reality is that it is only in focusing on the inner, that everything in the outer naturally, effortlessly and perfectly resolves itself. When you do it this way, there is no need for force or hustle of any kind.

So essentially, we have life BACKWARDS.

Let’s turn things back around.  It’s about time\!

**Here’s a summary of how to ace life the inward way:**

1. Stop all judgment, blame, condemnation, criticism and dislike of others and replace these with Love.  
2. Quit seeking happiness, wholeness, healing, fulfillment and love outside of yourself, and instead venture inwards and connect to your God Presence, which is essentially Infinite Consciousness flowing through you.
3. Make disciplining your mind \(and thus your thoughts\) your \#1 priority. Do this by learning to stay present to your inner chatter and consciously flooding your mind with only thoughts of divine love, abundance, well\-being, perfect health, divine beauty, divine perfection, harmony and joy. 
4. Guard your mind from any and all FEAR inputs. This includes the news, any and all limiting beliefs uttered by friends, family, actors, influencers, doctors, books, podcasts, etc. 
5. Choose to only ever see and focus on the Divinity of every other human.
6. Forgive everyone once and for all. 
7. Meditate daily on your God Presence, which essentially is Divine Love. Visualize it as a flame in your heart, growing larger and larger until it is completely encasing you. Really FEEL that love. \(This simple practice alone will completely transform your life\).

This list will only make sense and resonate deeply with you if you have a firm understanding of how the Universe works and understand the [Cosmic Law of Creation](http://iii).

In other words, if you understand that reality is entirely subjective and that we are each living in our own little holograms that reflect our own consciousness, then you’ll grasp why the most powerful thing you could ever do is clean up your insides: your thoughts and feelings. Because your thoughts and feelings are CREATIVE, which means they are actively bringing things into physicality for YOU.

So rid your mind of all yuckiness \- blame, resentment, criticism, condemnation, dislike, judgment, etc, and fill it with Divine Love in its myriad forms: Love, Peace, Blessings, Acceptance, Compassion, Generosity, Harmony, etc, and your outer world will HAVE  to conform\!

By doing the things on this list \- you will essentially be breaking up the dam that you unwittingly created through your adoption of limiting beliefs, and allow your pure God Presence to begin flowing again, unencumbered through you, bringing forth complete harmony, abundance and perfection in your outer world. This is the point at which you are able to manifest your desires instantly because all internal resistance is gone.
