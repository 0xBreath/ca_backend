# Anonymous Acts of Love Challenge

I challenge you to commit a completely Anonymous Act of Love. Do not tell anyone about it\! The point is to expand your heart without expanding your ego. This is what Divine Love is. Completely unselfish and unconditional. You love because you ARE love, not for self\-validation or an ego\-stroke.

Anonymous Acts of Love are a type of worship or prayer.

To give without any reward or any notice is deeply healing to the Spirit.

It is in the anonymity that true magic is created, both in the heart of the giver and the heart of the receiver, for this kind of love is unburdened by vanity, reciprocation or the need  for attention.

**Anonymous Acts of Love ideas:**

- Leave extra money with a cashier to pay for another person’s groceries/coffee/drive\-through order. 
- Call your electric/gas/water company and pay the balance of a \(or several\) delinquent account\(s\).  
- Pay the balance of someone’s Kmart layaway account.  
- Leave money at a gas station letting the teller know to use it on someone who could obviously use the help. 
- Leave some flowers with a note reminding them that they are deeply loved, at a stranger’s front door. 
- Leave a super loving note on a stranger’s windshield.
- Write a bunch of love letters and leave them around town for strangers to find, trusting that the right people will be led to them. Include an inspiring quote or passage from your favorite book or poem or song or prayer. 
- Write a bunch of affirmations on post\-its and then go stick them on mirrors in public bathrooms or inside bathroom stalls.
- Leave a loving note of encouragement for a mama to find at a baby changing station. 
- Drop off a big bag of treats at a shelter with limited resources. 
- Pack a bunch of brown paper bags with pb and j’s and a drink and hand them out to some of our homeless brothers and sisters.

And of course, don’t forget that this is a practice you can adopt ongoing. No challenge or special occasion needed. It’s actually super addictive because there is truly nothing that feels better than being true to Who we really are: Love.
