# A Solid Self-Concept Looks Like This

Here’s a great illustration of the difference between a solid self\-concept and a weak one.

You’re walking down the street and see someone you know on the other side of the street. You smile at them. They make eye contact with you \(seemingly\) but don’t smile back and keep walking.

The person with the weak self\-concept becomes perturbed. Maybe they feel anxiety, maybe they feel confusion, maybe they feel insecure, but regardless, they are flustered and have flung into a narrative that doesn’t feel good: this person must either be upset with them or not like them. They spend the rest of the day ruminating over it, trying to analyze it, maybe calling a friend to discuss it, seek soothing or comfort or an ego boost. It’s safe to say that their day has been effectively ruined. All because someone didn’t smile back at them.

In contrast, the person with the solid self\-concept notices that the person doesn’t smile back at them, and immediately assumes that they just must not have seen them. After all, how often do we assume others are making eye contact when in fact they aren’t looking at us at all. As such, the person with the solid self\-concept moves on with their day completely unperturbed and doesn’t spend another second thinking about this. They have endured no suffering and have created no drama. 

Do you see the vast difference between these two states of consciousness?  

One lives on a perpetual emotional roller\-coaster at the whim of their circumstances, other people and other people’s behavior. Their confidence and good feeling are dependent on external conditions and validation and they need constant reassurance that they are liked, loved, seen, appreciated, etc. Their lives are filled with drama, big emotions and a deep insecurity that leaves them in a chronic state of anxiety.

Meanwhile, the other derives their joy from within, and because they deeply love and accept themselves, they expect and assume that others do too. There is no anxiety, no insecurity, no neediness. They do not ruminate, over\-analyze nor waste their time gossiping. Because they are so solid and feel whole on the inside, they are able to devote their time and energy to greater pursuits and thus these people tend to achieve far more in a lifetime than those with a weak self\-concept. Their relationships are far more fulfilling and peaceful and they tend to manifest their desires quickly and effortlessly. This is the power and magic of a solid self\-concept.
