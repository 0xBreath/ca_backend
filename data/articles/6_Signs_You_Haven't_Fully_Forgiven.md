# 6 Signs You Haven't Fully Forgiven

_\(and how to fully forgive once and for all\)_

**6 Signs you haven't fully forgiven:**

1. You still ruminate on or think about ‘the incident.’ 
2. At the mention of their name or when they cross your mind, you have an emotional reaction, even if super mild. Any reaction at all is a sign that you haven’t fully forgiven. 
3. You still bring the ‘incident’ up in conversation with others, even if infrequently. 
4. You still carry the feeling of having been ‘victimized.’
5. You have a hard time wishing this person well.  
6. You find it difficult to love this person \(not talking about romantic love\).

**First of all, why even forgive?**

When we choose \(because it’s always a choice\) to hold on to past hurts, the only person who ends up suffering is us. We worry that if we forgive, we’ll be condoning the harmful behavior or ‘letting them off the hook’ but forgiveness really has nothing to do with the other person and everything to do with our own wellbeing and liberation. When we don’t forgive, we keep ourselves energetically shackled to both the incident and the person. Moreover, by holding onto the pain, we lower our own frequency and end up attracting more yuck into our lives. Forgiveness is an act of self\-love. It’s saying: I’m choosing to let this go for good because I’m worthy of peace and joy.

**Things to keep in mind:**

- Forgiveness is not something that can be forced. 
- Not being able to or ready to forgive does not make you a ‘bad’ person. 
- Forgiveness has nothing to do with being ‘good’ or ‘bad’ it’s simply a reflection of your belief system. 
- Forgiveness has nothing to do with the other person and everything to do with you and your own peace and wellbeing.  
- To truly forgive someone is to realize there was never anything to forgive in the first place. 
- Forgiveness is essentially unburdening oneself of toxic self\-sabotaging emotional baggage.

**My experience with forgiveness:**

I’m at a place where I’ve fully forgiven every person who has ‘hurt’ me in one way or another. But here’s the thing. Forgiveness didn’t come when I ‘tried’ to forgive anyone. Forgiveness came when my understanding of how the Universe works solidified and when I came to understand Who I really am. In other words, when my belief system changed, it became _easy_ and _effortless_ to forgive, mainly because I realized there was nobody to forgive. It wasn’t a matter of going back to each individual incident and/or person and actively forgiving anyone, my forgiving everyone was a _byproduct_ of seeing life from a completely different perspective.

**The perspective shifts that resulted in effortless forgiveness:**

- There is no objective reality out there. Everything is subjective and relative to my own consciousness. This means that I’m living in my own self\-created simulated reality where everything and everyone is simply reflecting back to me my own beliefs/assumptions/expectations. This means that I am responsible for every single detail of my life. This means that there are no villains out there \- only people conforming to and acting out my beliefs. When I shift my insides, my outer reality must conform. 
- I came into this incarnation with specific [Soul Contracts](http://nnn) and thus, there are no real ‘villains.’

**Conclusion**:

If you are truly interested in your liberation and expansion, then complete forgiveness of absolutely everyone, including yourself, is necessary. That said, forgiveness is not something that can be forced. It's not something that we can be persuaded to do. So often people claim to have forgiven another, but within themselves they continue to hold onto a feeling of betrayal and a lack of trust. 

The inability to fully forgive comes from a lack of understanding of how the Universe actually works. Once you gain a deep understanding of Who you really are, why you incarnated into your human form and of the Universal laws that guide all things, you will have the clarity to effortlessly forgive absolutely every person that you perceive to have harmed you. 

Ultimately, true forgiveness is recognizing that there was never anything or anyone to forgive. Once you understand this with every inch of your being, you will never experience the world and others in the same way again. You will be free of all blame, resentment, hurt and disappointment.
