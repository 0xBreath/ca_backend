# How to Get Rid of Your Limiting Beliefs

Most of us have thousands of accumulated limiting beliefs that we’ve adopted over the course of our lifetime.

When we come to discover that they are the very thing responsible for creating all the yucky in our lives, we decide it’s time to clean up shop. To do a massive subconscious Spring cleaning.

We soon realize that it’s a never\-ending tedious process and begin to feel discouraged. I hear this a lot on my coaching calls. “How will I ever get rid of all my limiting beliefs?\! There’s an endless amount of them\!”

So I’m going to share with you the **most efficient** and **easiest** way to rewire your subconscious, so that it begins working for you instead of against you.

I call this **The Dirty Water Method.**

Imagine you have a glass of dirty water in front of you. That glass of dirty water is your subconscious. Every speck of dirt represents a limiting belief that’s mucking up your mind.

You want a crystal clear glass of water so you begin pouring clean water into the glass of dirty water. As you pour, water from inside the glass starts overflowing and you notice that the water inside the glass is getting clearer and clearer. Soon you find yourself with a crystal clear glass of water.

This is exactly how you will clean your subconscious up.

Instead of tediously trying to remove every speck of dirt from  the water, you simply inundate the glass with clean water and soon you’re left with only clean water\!

The same applies to your mind.

Instead of tediously trying to remove every limiting belief \(remember you’re likely picking up new ones daily if you’re not vigilant about what you feed your mind\), you inundate your mind with God thoughts: thoughts of peace, harmony, love, health, wealth, devotion, gratitude, perfection, etc. God thoughts are essentially life\-affirming thoughts that focus only on that which you  want to bring into your life.

As you persist in doing this, the God thoughts will crowd out the limiting beliefs. 

This method absolutely works, but does require discipline and persistence, much like anything else. You will be retraining your mind to focus only on life\-affirming thoughts, and as you do this, these things will begin showing up in your 3D reality, effortlessly. 

Once these new seeds \(thoughts\) are firmly planted in your subconscious, expect abundant fruit\!
