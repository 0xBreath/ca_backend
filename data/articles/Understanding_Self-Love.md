# Understanding Self-Love

**\(and what it really means to love yourself\)**

When most of us think of self\-love, we think of taking loving care of ourselves both on the outside and on the inside: speaking kindly to ourselves, loving on our inner child, letting go of relationships that are not life\-affirming, setting healthy boundaries, doing things that soothe us like taking baths or spending time in nature or working out or being creative in some way. Other ways we might show ourselves greater love is by forgiving ourselves, accepting ourselves as we are, saying no to things that don’t feel aligned with us or that we simply don’t care to do, prioritizing our truth, our intuition; honoring our feelings, taking ‘me’ time, fueling our bodies with nourishing foods and our minds with nourishing thoughts.

When you think about it, it’s really strange that we have to make a conscious effort to show ourselves love in this way. One would think that it would come completely naturally and effortlessly. Imagine not being able to say no to something you don’t want to do. I mean, it’s total madness.

So how did we get so lost? How did it become so difficult to say no? How did we get to a place of overlooking or under prioritizing taking basic care of ourselves?How did we come to forget who we really are? How did we become such consummate people\-pleasers who are so out of integrity with the truth of our being?

Well, it all begins in childhood. We are all born feeling whole, with no concept of ‘unworthiness’ or of lacking anything at all.

But at some point the adults in our lives begin to teach us that our worth is dependent on how we 'behave' and what we 'achieve.' Our caretakers smile at us and reward us when we please them and punish us when we displease them. Before we learn to speak, we learn to be 'good,’ to please and to achieve in order to be worthy of love. And being 'good' is arbitrary and dependent on the adult's needs. For some it involves being seen and not heard, for others it involves making no mistakes, and for others still it involves emotionally care\-taking the very adults setting the rules. Regardless of how being 'good' is defined, we get brainwashed into believing very early on that love is something outside of us that we have to earn. Over time, the deepest truth of our being \- that we are whole, perfect and worthy just by virtue of being alive \- gets buried.

And Bam\! Just like that we are thrust out of heaven. We forget who we really are \(Love\), and spend the rest of our lives on a fruitless quest attempting to get/find that love from a source outside of ourselves. On a quest to complete  ourselves…to fill an illusory void.

To do that we chase, control, manipulate, lie, over\-give, self\-sacrifice, become pushovers, succumb to flattery, become martyrs, say yes when we mean no, forfeit our authenticity, turn love into a system of checks and balances, and abandon ourselves over and over and over again.

All in the name of an illusion. Of something that CANNOT be found outside of ourselves.

Thankfully, we’ve begun to see the madness of our ways and have begun to address this debilitating epidemic.

We’ve decided enough is enough and that we are tired of feeling unworthy and tired of seeking love outside of ourselves. Instead, we are now:

_"Buying ourselves flowers. Drawing our name in the sand. Talking to ourselves for hours. Taking ourselves dancing and holding our own hand."_ \- Miley Cyrus

Which basically means that we are finally showing up for ourselves instead of expecting/waiting on others to show up for us. And we’re calling this ‘self\-love.’ And that’s exactly what it is: us showing love to our small self, our surface self, our ego.

But here’s the catch: our small self is BY DEFINITION under the illusion of separation. It cannot and will NEVER feel whole no matter how many baths we take or how many flowers we buy ourselves or how often we hold our own hand.

What's actually causing us to seek love outside of ourselves is not a lack of love for our \(small\) self, but the illusion that we are separate from God\! The small self can never feel whole but the higher self \(your God self\) has never forgotten its wholeness. It is by definition WHOLENESS.

Therefore, I would argue that true self\-love is not an action....it's a KNOWING. A knowing of who you really are \(God\). An understanding that YOU ARE NOT YOUR SMALL SELF. YOU ARE NOT YOUR PERSONALITY, YOUR BODY, YOUR MIND. You are the pure limitless  consciousness that BREATHES the body and THINKS the mind.

It's the difference between 'I love myself' and 'I AM love'.

Until you sit still enough, for long enough to discover WHO you really are, beyond the body and mind \- until you sit still enough, for long enough to actively FEEL the presence of God flowing life through you \- you will never truly understand what self\-love is. True self\-love is turning to God \- to the consciousness that breathes you, and realizing that THAT’S who you really are. You ARE love. Your entire BEING\-NESS is love.

And when you finally know that, not intellectually, but experientially, taking care of yourself becomes effortless.

Lastly, the most rewarding thing we will ever do, as humans, is to love, uplift and serve others. As someone wise once said, the secret to living is giving. When we are pre\-occupied with 'loving ourselves' and trying to feel more whole, we naturally become more self\-absorbed. But when we finally realize who we are and reconnect to our inherent wholeness and perfection, we become free to serve others without needing to worry about getting depleted, for now, we are drawing upon God who is limitless, and thus, we too, become limitless.
