# Understanding the Point of the Human Experience

**_\(and why there's nothing serious going on here\)_**

This human life is all about growth and expansion and thus this is simply Earth School, one big never\-ending classroom where the ultimate goal is to awaken to our true nature, to Who we really are, which essentially is God…which essentially is Love.

During our time at Earth School,  we are presented with unlimited opportunities to grow. Every interaction, incident, challenge, obstacle and hardship is happening _for_ us, offering us the chance to expand and liberate ourselves from our self\-created mental prisons.

Whenever we are  faced with adversity  in whatever form, we always have 3 choices:  

1. To grow 
2. To stay stuck 
3. To regress

**Growth looks like:**

Forgiveness, personal accountability, equanimity, unconditional love, nonjudgment, understanding and applying Universal Law, reverence, gratitude, compassion, inner peace, lightness of being, laughter, joy, flexibility, sincerity, an open mind, being a lifelong student, humility, kindness, service, inner solidity, patience, courage, faith, persistence, playful curiosity.

**Staying stuck looks like:**

Fear, anxiety, depression, people\-pleasing, a lack of authenticity, an inability to say no and speak one’s truth, an inability to make decisions, doubt, skepticism, denial, complacency, hopelessness, passivity, shyness, laziness, a refusal to learn lessons, blaming others/God/life for one’s circumstances, entitlement, escapism, despair, unworthiness, knowing Universal Law but not applying it, victimhood.

**Regression looks like:**

Anger, judgment, aggression, condemnation, arrogance, rigidity, superiority, rage, martyrdom, violence, abuse, gossip, holding grudges, resentment, envy, jealousy, dishonesty, self\-absorption, vanity, addiction, lying, stealing, harming oneself or others, complaining, whining.

Most people have a foot in each camp. That’s ok. There’s no God outside of yourself that’s judging you. There’s no shame in where you currently are. Again, this is Earth SCHOOL. We’re here to grow so it’s natural that we should all have things to ‘work on.’

That said, why make the effort to choose growth then? 

Two reasons: **inner liberation** and **inner peace**, which in my humble opinion are the holy grail of life. 

What’s the point of becoming  a master manifester if you’re still struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, unworthiness, anger, blame etc?

And what is life without peace? A constant struggle. A constant drama. Constant stress. Illness. A lack of fulfillment. A lack of joy. Heaviness.

When we get in the habit of choosing growth over and over and over again, even if that means temporary discomfort \- we move towards that seemingly elusive inner peace \- except I’ll be the first to tell you, it's not as elusive as you think it is\! Unlearning all your accumulated negative programming and seeing through the illusion created by the mind does not have to take years.

Massive shifts in consciousness can happen in seconds, usually only requiring a tiny shift in perspective. Life isn’t meant to be heavy and serious and depressing. This life is a miracle \- a gift, an incredible opportunity to embark on the most incredible, fulfilling, rewarding, and liberating inner adventure to the depths of your being, so that you may discover who you really are beyond your meat suit and your mind.

One of the biggest keys to my joy is that I choose to remain in a state  of playful curiosity. So when something yuck happens, I get playfully curious about it. What was I believing about this topic or person that drew this to me? Where in my thinking am I still limited and not in alignment with the  truth of my being? How can I pivot? What do I need to let go of? This keeps things light and fun. It’s all just a game anyways. A simulation. A hologram of your own consciousness. 

Do you see?
