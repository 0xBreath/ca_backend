# Relationship Hack #1

**_\(Do this one thing to elevate your relationship\)_**

Stop compromising and stop asking your partner to compromise. 

Here's why:

First you must understand that all words are neutral until we attach a collective narrative to them. The word ‘compromise’ is attached to a narrative that involves a _sacrifice_ of some sort. Anytime anyone uses the word compromise, they are explicitly stating that they are agreeing to do something they don’t actually want to do, for the benefit of the relationship. And that’s not it \- they are also saying that they expect you to also agree to do something you don’t want to do…for the benefit of the relationship. Tit for tat. “We must both make sacrifices for this to work.” This creates a relationship between two martyrs.

Remember that perspective is EVERYTHING. If I perceive my doing something as a sacrifice, it won’t feel good to me, simply by virtue of the narrative I’ve attached to my action. I will feel, even if not consciously, resentful and limited.

Couples who have an implicit agreement around compromise will end up in lackluster partnerships that slowly erode over time and lose their magic as a result of the gradual accumulation of perceived sacrifices that acts as a tightening noose around the relationship, at some point ending in its death. This is the whole ‘ball and chain’ analogy.

Our marriages are not meant to limit us, nor are they meant to encourage us to limit, control or manipulate our partner \- **quite the opposite actually**. They are meant to offer us the opportunity to liberate ourselves from the shackles of our mind and _become_ Love. In doing so, we become unconditionally loving and can offer our partner the true gift of real love = freedom.

Compromise is _always_ a lose\-lose proposition. It’s two people settling for a reality neither wants.

Compromise kills the magic in relationships because it’s founded on the belief that our partner must change their behaviors or preferences in order for us to feel ok, be happy and/or stay in the relationship.

It usually sounds like: “I’d rather stay home and read, and you’d rather go out and socialize, so how about we compromise and two times a month we’ll stay in, and two times a month we’ll go socialize.”

But what if we took compromise completely out of the equation?

If your priority is your own liberation and spiritual expansion, then you know that anytime you are dependent on anything external changing so YOU can feel ok, you just perpetuate your self\-created prison.  This is co\-dependence.

What if, instead of asking your partner to compromise, you gave them the freedom to do whatever feels best for them? And what if you gave yourself the freedom to do whatever feels best to _you_?

What if you stopped asking your partner to compromise and instead _let go_ of whatever you think you ‘need’ from them to be happy. This is the quickest way to your own liberation AND the quickest way to a drama\-free magical partnership.

Compromise comes from the belief that life should be ‘fair’ and that marriage should be a system of checks and balances. But just to be clear, love does not keep tabs. Only the ego does. Love does not need reciprocation. Only the ego does. Love loves because that is its nature.  When you become more preoccupied with giving love than with receiving it, your relationships will transform themselves for the better.

How do you do this? You must first become completely solid within yourself. You must first feel whole and complete within you. You must come to a place of such unwavering inner knowing of Who you really are, that all neediness is gone. Only then can you offer your partner the freedom of unconditional love without it feeling like a compromise or sacrifice to you.

This is big stuff. Higher consciousness love like this is still very rare in our world. Most people come at their relationships from a place of incompleteness and neediness because they have not yet found the Kingdom of God within themselves. Compromise is born of this neediness.

So if you’re truly ready to up\-level your relationship \- prioritize your concept of self. The truest indicator of inner solidity is being completely unperturbed and unfazed \(which means zero emotional reaction\) to both criticism AND compliments. That’s when you’ll know you have \*arrived.\*
