# 8 Powerful Manifestation Tips

1. **You need to EXPERIENCE the state, not just think about it.**

If you’re wanting to manifest a boat, it’s not enough to just imagine the boat \- you must imagine yourself ON the boat, walking around on it, and doing whatever you would be doing on it, if you had it. Experience yourself driving/sailing the boat, tanning yourself on the boat, jumping off the boat into the water, docking the boat, etc.

1. **You need to reside in the state of having it or being it.**

And how do you know if you’re residing in the state? You are completely unperturbed by the 3D. So if you’re trying to manifest clear skin, you know you’re residing in the ‘state of having clear skin’ if when you look in the mirror and see the 3D \(your zits\), you are completely unperturbed by them because you can FEEL the reality of your clear skin and thus KNOW it’s on its way and the 3D means absolutely nothing.

1. **Stop discussing the old state and behaving from it.**

This includes with yourself, with others, in your journal, in your thoughts, all of it\! Banish all thoughts about the old state from your mind. So with the clear skin example, if you already had clear skin, you wouldn’t complain about your skin, you wouldn’t be researching foods or creams that help clear up skin, you wouldn’t notice other people’s clear skin because clear skin would be a completely moot point to you because you already have it\! So you wouldn’t think about it\!

1. **Choose to have unwavering Faith in the Law**

Anytime you’re feeling impatient, anxious, doubting or hopeless about your manifestation you are doubting the Law. And whenever you doubt the Law, you block your manifestation from materializing. Universal law cannot and doesn’t ever fail. You are always manifesting whatever you’re believing, so if you’re doubting, then you’ll manifest not receiving that which you want. You’re the only Operant power. So just decide once and for all that you’re fully onboard with the law, and then sit back and let the magic unfold.

1. **Don’t discuss your manifestations with anyone else.**

Keep your desires and manifestations between you and God. When you discuss them with others, not only do you scatter the energy, but you also open yourself up to being infected by other people’s doubt and limitations. When others project their doubt onto you, it’s not because they don’t love you or believe in you, but simply that they don’t understand the law and know about their unlimited power to create. Whether you’re conscious of it or not, when those you respect and care about express any sort of doubt or disbelief with regards to your desires, you are being negatively affected by them. Best to keep them to yourself until they materialize.

1. **Observe your reactions throughout the day.**

Your reactions will always let you know what state you’re residing in. You’ll need to be super honest with yourself and really acknowledge when you notice yourself getting perturbed no matter how mildly. If you’re manifesting clear skin and you notice that whenever you see someone with flawless skin you get fixated on it, lust after it and then feel bad about your own skin, you’ll know you’re not residing in the state of having clear skin. It can be challenging in the beginning to maintain the desired state for very long but the more you do it, even if you start off just feeling into the state for a minute, you’ll increase that time every time you do it. Persist. It’s like growing a muscle.

1. **Persist, persist, persist\!**

Your mind will want to get lazy and return its attention to the 3D that’s RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU and that takes no effort to see. But you MUST persist in your INNER VISION. It takes great discipline but if you can do this, you’ll be successful in bringing about what you desire. Most of us spend so much of our time on autopilot. This is not helpful. You need to increase your awareness, your time spent in the PRESENT actively feeling yourself  into your desired state.

1. **Remind yourself all day long that you are LIMITLESS.**

We are programmed from a young age to believe in limitations. To believe that there are powers outside of us that we have no control over. To believe that we are these small fallible human forms that live at the mercy of our genetics, circumstances, bacteria and statistics. It’s all BULLSHIT. You are the God of your reality and there is absolutely NOTHING you cannot create, nothing you cannot cure, and nothing you cannot be.

1. **Be like a blowtorch.**

When it comes to your desires and imaginings, be like a blowtorch. The more concentrated your imagining and the greater the intensity of your feeling, the faster your manifestation will materialize. Concentration is key.
