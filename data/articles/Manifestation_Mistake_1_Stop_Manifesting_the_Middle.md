# Manifestation Mistake #1: Stop Manifesting The Middle

Something I come across so often on my coaching calls is this confusion when it comes to creating your imaginal scene. Instead of going to the very END of your desire, you think you need to manifest it in multiple steps.

For example, if your desire is to be happily married and you have a specific person in mind, you don’t need to be manifesting them asking you out on a date, or returning your text, or even proposing.

That would be messing with the ‘middle’ which you obviously _can_ do, but why make things harder than they need to be? Why waste time? Why not instead create an imaginal scene where you are celebrating your 10 year wedding anniversary, which then not only implies that you’re happily married, but also that you’ve been happily married for 10 years\! Because let’s face it, most of us don’t just want marriage, we want a fulfilling, joyful, nourishing one.

The reason that I think so many people don’t do this and really go to the very end of their desire is because their conscious mind pipes in and says that’s too far out \- there’s too much ‘space’ to fill between now and then. But that’s just not true. This is the easiest way. Truly. Once you’ve fused with the imaginal scene and thus planted your seed, all you need do is rest in your unwavering faith in the law and as your 3D reality begins to rearrange itself around you and you begin to receive inspired action, don’t ask questions, don’t doubt, don’t analyze, don’t be impatient.

Simply remind yourself that everything from now until the 10 year anniversary is a [bridge of incident](http://kkk), moving you in the most efficient way to your desired end.

As Neville used to say: “the Universe has ways \(to fulfill your desire\) you know not of.” Which essentially means that your conscious mind is far too limited to even FATHOM the infinite ways your desire can be made manifest.

I used marriage as an example but this applies to any manifestation. Perfect health, your dream career, financial abundance, etc. Stop trying to manifest the next check or your prospective employer calling you to offer you the job. Instead, fast forward and see yourself living your life from a place of financial prosperity, and imagine yourself into the state of being a successful leader in your field.

Remember, no desire is too far\-fetched or more difficult to manifest. You just need to BELIEVE in the law, fuse with your imaginal scene, and then sit back and let the magic happen.
