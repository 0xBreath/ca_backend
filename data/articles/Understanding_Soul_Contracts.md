# Understanding Soul Contracts

**_\(and why there are no real villains anywhere\)_**

Before incarnating into our current bodies, we made Soul Contracts with all the major players in our lives. Our parents, children, siblings, spouses and any other significant relationships. A Soul Contract is essentially an agreement between two souls, specifying the role they will play for each other in this lifetime. 

Within the context of this being Earth School and us being here to grow and evolve, some contracts are life\-giving and soothing and act as a support through the human life. These are the effortlessly loving relationships in our lives. Others are chosen specifically _for_ the pain and turmoil they bring. It may be difficult to believe, but every \(seeming\) villain in our life was a role WE assigned before being born. 

I’m going to use my life as an example:

The two most challenging relationships in my life have been with my mother and sister: the two biggest ‘villains’ in my life. I wanted nothing more than a close loving relationship with both, but what I got \(chose\) instead was a constant influx of rage, anger, criticism and blame. Before incarnating as Oriana, I asked my mother and sister to play their contentious,  emotionally abusive roles knowing that these challenging relationships would be the catalysts needed for my deepest growth in this lifetime.

I can easily say that were it not for my mother and sister, I would not have achieved the level of self\-awareness and inner freedom that I live with today. Their withholding of unconditional love and their constant criticism, anger and rage towards me broke me wide open and _forced_ me to ask myself who I really am beyond other people’s opinions of me. 

This understanding has created a deep gratitude for these two beautiful beings who so faithfully fulfilled their contracts with me. You see, there are no real villains. Every person in our lives is simply an actor in our play,  playing the role we assigned to them, in order for us to grow. This is Earth School, after all, and our primary reason for being here is to evolve and ultimately, awaken. My love for them and my gratitude for their dedication to helping me awaken is ineffable. 

Once you really understand about Soul Contracts, all blame and victimhood forever disappear and instead, you begin to see all the challenging people in your life as your most Beloved teachers and feel an overflowing of gratitude and love for them. And once you get there, you have learned the lesson you came here to learn through them and your understanding catalyzes and alchemizes the relationship. 

It is important to note that before incarnating, some of us get a little over\-zealous about evolving and choose insanely painful relationships. Once here, we forget that this is Earth School and we get lost in the pain and flounder. This is why I feel so called to share this knowledge because when you finally see it all from the Birds Eye spiritual perspective, everything becomes lighter and easier to endure. And then instead of blame, anger and resentment, we are able to ask instead:

**What is the lesson here? What did I intend to learn through this experience/relationship?**

And that, my friends, is when true expansion happens.
