# Why Animals Are So Easy To Love

**_\(and humans are not\)_**

The short answer: animals don't have egos. Humans do.

The long answer:

They can’t talk back, they don’t hold grudges, they don’t judge us, they aren’t unkind, they don’t try and control or manipulate us, they don’t try and compete with us, they forgive us instantly, and most important of all: **they love us unconditionally**. When we leave them alone for hours on end, do they greet us passive aggressively or sulk or get angry? Nope. They come running at us like it’s freaking Christmas and as if seeing us again is the best thing that’s ever happened to them, lol. Animals are much more concerned with giving love than receiving it, and they are fully present with us. Animals are also completely transparent which means that their energy is always clean. They’re very clear about what they want, when they want it, and what they like or don’t like. No beating around the bush. They’re also 100% authentically themselves. They’re not trying to be a cat if they’re a dog or a dog if they’re a cat.

Do you see why the reason it’s so easy to love our animals is because of their complete lack of ego? This then creates the space for us to show up without ego. And what ensues? Magic.

But when it comes to loving humans who do have egos, often very strong ones, it becomes a lot more challenging to love unconditionally. Why would you want to love someone who constantly speaks back to you, tries to control and manipulate you, is easily offended, or needy or angry? Someone who’s not always happy to see you, and who judges and criticizes you. Someone who is flawed and imperfect. Someone who has so much negative programming that it’s genuinely unpleasant to be in their presence.

Well, I’ll tell you why. It’s the same reason you choose to forgive others. Because it leads to your own liberation\! 

Here’s why:

Love is _who_ and _what_ we are. The consciousness that gives us life, that breathes us, God: is Love. Pure unconditional Love. That is the Truth of our being.

Anytime we withhold love from another, we are essentially blocking our true nature which never feels good. The ego will do a great job of validating and justifying our withholding of love. It will remind us how unlovable and how unworthy of our love the person is. It will compile a list of all the ugly, yucky things they have done to us. It will find all the reasons why it’s OK not to love this person.

And since you have free will, it will absolutely be your prerogative to not love that person if you so choose. But you must know that this choice comes with a consequence, and that consequence is that uncomfortable feeling of being out of integrity with your Self. Your Higher Self. Your True Self.

You can certainly ignore that uncomfortable feeling. Suppress it. Deny it. Most of us do. You can feed the ego instead of the Higher Self. But if you are radically honest with yourself, you’ll notice that the more people you choose to not love \(this includes mild dislike\) and the more injustices you collect and the more judgments you harbor: **the more closed your heart will become and the less vibrant and less alive you will feel.** This is because you are out of integrity with Who You Really Are: **Love**.

If you’ve decided that you want to love more and judge less; how do you go about doing this?

By practicing. 

It may seem too simple an answer but the behaviors that become habitual are the ones that have imprinted on our subconscious and the way we imprint our subconscious is through repetition. The more you practice choosing to see others through the eyes of God, the easier it will become, until one day it will be your default.

Begin by becoming aware of the judgmental thoughts constantly running through your mind about others. Remind yourself that those thoughts belong to the ego, not to who you really are. They are just the result of negative programming and you need not take them seriously. Just notice them. As long as you are _aware_ of them, you are not acting on them or feeding them.

Next, begin consciously feeding your mind thoughts of Love. Remind yourself every time you see another human, that they, just like you, are God in a meatsuit. Bless them in your mind and heart. Send them love \(using your thoughts\), wish for them everything you wish for yourself. Recognize their inherent divinity.

**On a side note:** loving another doesn’t mean they need to be active in your life or you active in theirs. You don’t need to speak to them or see them in order to love them. It’s ok to have a preference about who you want to surround yourself with.

Try this practice out for a couple weeks and see how you feel. If it doesn’t resonate with you, that’s ok. You may not be ripe for this kind of practice yet. Most likely though, you’ll notice a lightness of being, a weight lifted from your shoulders, a warmth in your heart. Increased joy. Increased vitality. It feels good to love. It feels good to be aligned with the Truth of your being.

And if you forget what unconditional love looks like, look at your dog or cat. Observe them. See how freely they love you. How pure their love for you is. Now go out and emulate that.
