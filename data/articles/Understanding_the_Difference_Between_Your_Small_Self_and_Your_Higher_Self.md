# Understanding the Difference Between Your Small Self and  Your Higher Self

Each of us is made up of two parts:

1. Our human fallible small self which is directed by our ego
2. Our infallible higher Divine self \- which is essentially our REAL self \(who we really are\) \- which is directed by our God Presence.

The small self is the part of us that believes in the illusion of separation. It's the 'me me me' cry that is inherently selfish and self\-serving and whose main concern is to gratify sense desires: sex, money, addiction, vanity, pleasure, instant gratification, excess, competition, material success. 

It's the part of us that feels a need to prove itself, that compares itself to others, that feels envy, jealousy, superiority, inferiority, unworthy, lonely, depressed, anxious. It's the part of us that is perpetually grasping for external things in order to feel better. It's the part of us that is never at peace, the part of us that gets its feelings hurt and gets offended and defensive. 

The Small Self is always leads us to greater discord and disharmony. It's the part of us responsible for all our pain and suffering, all illness, all drama and all scarcity. It's needy and demanding and at complete odds with who we really are. The driving force of the small self is _fear_. 

In contrast, the Higher Self or God Self is the _real_ you that knows you are inextricably connected to everything and everyone and thus, knows that to hurt or harm another \(in thought or deed\) is to hurt and harm yourself. 

The driving force of the Higher Self is _Love._ 

The Higher Self is the part of you that loves unconditionally, that is completely whole within itself, and whose ‘raison d’êtres’ is quite simply to love and serve others. It is marked by compassion, cooperation, a deep unwavering peace, and a magnetic _being\-ness_ that uplifts, inspires and heals everything it comes into contact with. It is pure, unadulterated God consciousness. It’s also the part of you that is responsible for all inspired ideas and inventions and creations. It’s the source of your creativity and genius. And it’s the source of all wisdom and all solutions. 

We are all born deeply connected to our Higher Selves until we are gradually taught to abandon it in exchange for our Small Self. Thus begins the destructive human brainwashing we all endure, that results in us forgetting who we really are and then setting off on a relentless pursuit of external gratification and validation. 

The spiritual journey is essentially a process of reconnecting to and thus identifying more with and _living more from_ your Higher Self. In fact, it’s not even a question of living more from it, but more of _allowing_ it to flow through you unhindered and unobstructed by your small self. Your God Self is continuously pouring through you love, harmony, perfect health, abundance and light \- but if your small self has been given the steering wheel \(your mind\), it takes this Pure Perfect energy and qualifies it with discord and inharmony. 

So essentially, in every moment you have the choice \(this is what free\-will is\) to embody your Small Self or to embody your Higher Self, and you make this choice by the thoughts you choose to think. When you are thinking thoughts of love, harmony, peace and goodwill and choosing to see the divine perfection in every being, you are allowing your God Self to flow through you, and this will _always_ bring to you greater abundance, well\-being and goodness. It’s _law_.

When you are thinking thoughts of ill\-will, condemnation, dislike,  judgment, criticism, hate, fear, competition, etc, and choosing to see the imperfection in everything and every being, you are making yourself a magnet to greater discord, pain, suffering and  scarcity. It’s _law_.

So it’s like the story of the two wolves. Which will you feed? Which are you feeding in every moment? Your Small Self or your Higher Self?

**THE CHOICE IS ALWAYS YOURS.**

And remember, one _always_ feels good, and the other _always_ feels bad.
