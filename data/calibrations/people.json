Marx's theories, collectively known as Marxism, focused on class struggle and the critique of capitalism. He argued that in a capitalist society, the working class (proletariat) would eventually rise against the capitalist class (bourgeoisie), leading to a classless, socialist society where the means of production were collectively owned. Marx's ideas have had a profound influence on political and economic thought and have played a pivotal role in shaping the course of history and political movements.",
