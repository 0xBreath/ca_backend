    "description": "Karl Marx (1818-1883) was a German philosopher, economist, and political theorist who co-authored \"The Communist Manifesto\" with Friedrich Engels and laid the groundwork for modern communism. Marx's theories, collectively known as Marxism, focused on class struggle and the critique of capitalism. He argued that in a capitalist society, the working class (proletariat) would eventually rise against the capitalist class (bourgeoisie), leading to a classless, socialist society where the means of production were collectively owned. Marx's ideas have had a profound influence on political and economic thought and have played a pivotal role in shaping the course of history and political movements.",
